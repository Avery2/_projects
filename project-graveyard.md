# Project Graveyard

This is a place to write about failed or abandoned projects. It's basically so I don't feel like it was wasted effort and to encourage me to kill projects that aren't working.

List of dead projects:

1. Project Graveyard: This project. I thought I would write about these failed projects that never reached a polished state but who was I kidding?
