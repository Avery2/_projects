# Tools

This is feels egotistical to write about but it's fun to talk about.

<!-- Note tasks Done -->

<!-- > [The] key to any lasting productivity system is to keep it as simple as possible and to use it as often as possible. Your tool should be versatile enough to handle your most complex projects yet simple enough to maintain when youâ€™re low on energy.

## Core Tools

- Things3
- Notion
- Complice

### Things3

> A central premise of [Getting Things Done] is ... moving your tasks and ideas outside of your mind and recording them externally in a place you can trust ... This frees your mind from remembering and allows you to focus on completing your tasks. [Some Blog](https://www.thebrain.com/blog/gtd)

### Complice

> Virtually all to-do list software on the internet, whether it knows it or not, is based on the GTD philosophy (David Allen's "Getting Things Done"). \\
> The main paradigmatic differences of Complice, compared to GTD-based systems are as follows:
> - choosing & doing, over organizing
> - aliveness, instead of exhaustiveness
> - goals as fundamental, rather than tasks
> - proactive, rather than reactive
>
